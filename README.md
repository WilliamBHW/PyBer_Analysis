# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a multi-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Based on the graph and previous graphs, analyze how these city type differ from each other and how decisions can be made based on the result.

## Background
>V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
