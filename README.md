# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a multi-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Based on the graph and previous graphs, analyze how these city type differ from each other and how decisions can be made based on the result.

## Background
>V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results
Based on the ride-sharing-data and PyBer summary data frame, it is clear that urban cities have the most shares of rides and drivers.
##### PyBer Summary

<br>

With multi-line graph on weekly fares, they combined to produce the trending on fares for each city type as follow:
- Urban cities have starting at around $1500 having consistant growth until early March. By the end of April, the fare ended at around $2000.
- Suburban cities have starting price around $700 as of Jan 16. As tge line develop, the fare went up to around $1500 in late February and droped in early March. The fare have an upward growth back to around $1500 as the time reaching the end of April
- Rural cities have price around $200 at the starting of Jan 16. As the line develop, this fare has the lease floating between $200 and $500 as the end of April.

## Summary
Based on the shares of ride, it is clear that most rides occur at urban cities with a high demand during January to March. The fares having unstable trend during March to April indicated that fare price have affected people's decision whether to take a ride. Keeping price of a single ride at $24 could inbcrease the demand.
##### Ride Share

<br>

Suburban and rural cities combined to have less than 20% of drivers, hiring drivers and decrease the fare price a little would help to expand their sharing on rides.
##### Driver Share

Rural cities have the least fare share compared with the other two. The fare price never intersect from the ride-sharing-data indicating that customer volumes are stable under each fare price. Dropping farea price to $30 while keepiong average fare per driver will give more oppertunity to people to choose rural rides.
